                <p class="lead"> Time is running out in 2016 to help Wikipedia. When I made Wikipedia a non-profit, people warned me I’d regret it. Over a decade later, it’s the only top ten site run by a non-profit and a community of volunteers. Has it crossed my mind how much we could have made if it had ads? Sure. But I believe people wouldn’t want to build it and we wouldn't be able to trust it. To protect our independence, we'll never run ads. We're sustained by donations averaging about $15. Now is the time we ask. If everyone reading this gave $3, our fundraiser would be done within an hour. That's right, the price of a cup of coffee is all we need. It’s easy to ignore this message, most people do. But I hope you’ll think about how useful Wikipedia is in your life. It’s there to help you understand the world around you. Please help us keep Wikipedia online and growing. Thank you

                <p>As inhabitants of this Earth, one of our main priorities is to protect the environment that has been given to us. While many people may have forgotten about the importance of protecting and maintaining Earth, there exists a series of organizations whose main purpose is to protect all natural aspects of the planet we call home. Two of the major organizations are Greenpeace and the Surfrider Foundation. Each has goals that are very like the other but are more specific in certain areas. The main goal of Greenpeace, as explained by the organization, is “to expose environmental criminals, and to challenge government and corporations when they fail to live up to their mandate…”. Surfrider’s environmental focus is much less broad than that of Greenpeace. The Surfrider Foundation strives to protect the ocean, beaches, and waves. Both organizations have clear objectives and are serious about attaining their goals.</p>

                <p>Greenpeace is an organization that fights to save all aspects of nature. As explained on their website, it is a non-profit organization that works to discontinue environmental degradation. According to Greenpeace, the organization began in 1971 when a group of peaceful environmental activists sailed into Alaska by boat to protest with intent to stop a series of underground nuclear tests that were being done by the United States government. Some of the main Greenpeace campaigns include stopping climate change, protecting tropical rainforests, eliminating toxic chemicals, and stopping the nuclear threat (Greenpeace). They are considered to be a radical activist group by many because of the level of protesting that they undertake.</p>

                <p>Every day in America and around the world, men and women go about their everyday lives. However, these lives can greatly vary. Someone in America might walk every day with a sense of security, peace of mind, and money in their wallet, while people in not so fortunate situations walk every day to find water, or in hope of getting their food rations for the day. Despite their situations, there is one connection. They usually have someone fighting to protect them. Even though not everyone enjoys reading about the military, the novel The Warrior’s Heart: Becoming a man of Compassion and Courage by Eric Greitens is inspirational and entertaining because it discusses how the Navy SEALs make a frontline impact in wars, how their strong-willed warrior mentality helps them protect the people who cannot protect themselves, and book reviewers rave about Greiten’s moral teachings through his adventure.</p>
